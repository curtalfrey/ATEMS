ATEMS - Automated Tool and Equipment Management System

Overview:

ATEMS is an inventory control software for tools rooms, warehouses, supply chain operations. 

I am a US Air Force (F-16 crew chief) Vet who has worked in the tool room/supplychain supervisor postion, also in farming, trucking, retail, nuclear, cyber sec industries. This software will be advanced enough to work in any of those enviroments or for a small business too.

The approach here is to be as modularized as possible. Where the basic program stays the same and you just plug-in the modules you need for your particular industry.

Automated - makes accountability easy with integrated email reminders sent to customers to bring back items on time. Also sends out emails to prevent jobs from being done with tools and/or equipment overdue for calibration. 

Barcode tracking - incorporates active/passive RFID barcoding with scan-gun or phone/tablet app. 


ATEMS Tracks:

where is the item stored
who checked in/out
what job it was used on
how long it has been checked out
what condition it was at check in/out

Equipment -
